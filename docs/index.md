## What is Prez?

Prez is an open source web application API that delivers "profiles of Knowledge Graph data".

Prez is most commonly used to publish:

* lists of managed vocabularies
* catalogues of semantic resources
* spatial reference datasets

In addition to Prez the main API tool, there are a series of smaller tools - scripts - that can be used to prepare [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web) for publication by Prez. These, and the Prez system use the Prez namespace, which is this web address:

* `https://prez.dev/`

## How can I get Prez?

While being open source, Prez is mostly maintained by [KurrawongAI](https://kurrawong.ai) who provide professional services to assist with its use, see the [Prez Docs](https://docs.kurrawong.ai/prez/Overview)
